The attached notebook makes use of an Attention UNet Model to perform pixel wise segmentation on the BraTS2020 Dataset. The dataset consists of slices of brain images. The pixel is classified into three classes: Necrotic (NEC), Edema (ED), and Tumor (ET). The model achieves an IoU score of 77 at the end of its training
